        Thanks for taking the time to create a bug report. If you are not quite sure what's going wrong, or why something is happening, please create a Support Ticket in the first instance by emailing [support@adam-rms.com](mailto:support@adam-rms.com).
        Our support team will troubleshoot with you and try to figure out why something is doing what it's doing! They may be able to fix it with you, or they may ask you to open an issue here
      options:
        - No - I'm self hosting AdamRMS so the support team can't help
        - No - I haven't yet heard back from Support, and following the posted security policy I am now publicly reporting the existence of an issue, to make direct contact with a maintainer
        - No - I have steps to reproduce this issue, and I think I know what's causing it
        - No - I'm an experienced maintainer and I've found/suspect I've found root cause
        - Yes - Support then came back to me and suggested I report it here
